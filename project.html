            <h2>Pong Game</h2>
            <p>
                This is the first game we made last year, we made it together with the teacher,<br>
                but we had to add one game mode ourselves. I created an extra game mode called<br> 'wall mode,'
                where there was a wall in the middle to make it go a lot faster.

            <h2>Website</h2>
            <p>
                I built this website in WordPress as an exercise for digital skills.<br>
                We could choose what we wanted to improve,<br>
                and I chose WordPress because I enjoy working with it.<br>
                We had only used it twice before,<br>
                so I wanted to add some elements to it that I didn't know how to work with.

            <h2>Single Player Game</h2>
            <p>
            I made this game last periode for an asignment that was given to us for Development.<br>
            I have had a few isues but those are all fixed so it is a working game now.<br>
            To create this game I used Unity and C#.<br>
