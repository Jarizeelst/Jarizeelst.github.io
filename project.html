            <h2>Pong Game</h2>
            <p>
            This is the first game we made last year, we made it together with the teacher,<br>
            but we had to add one game mode ourselves.I created an extra game mode called<br> 'wall mode,'
            where there was a wall in the middle to make it go a lot faster.

            <h2>Website</h2>
            <p>
                I built this website in WordPress as an exercise for digital skills.<br>
                We could choose what we wanted to improve,<br>
                and I chose WordPress because I enjoy working with it.<br>
                We had only used it twice before,<br>
                so I wanted to add some elements to it that I didn't know how to work with.
