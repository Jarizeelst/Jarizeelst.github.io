            <h2>Pong Game</h2>
            <p>
                This is the first game we made last year. We collaborated with the teacher,<br>
                but we also had to add an additional game mode ourselves.<br>
                I created an extra game mode called 'wall mode,'<br>
                where a wall was placed in the middle to increase the speed of the game significantly.

            <h2>Website</h2>
            <p>
                I built this website in WordPress as an exercise for digital skills.<br>
                We could choose what we wanted to improve, and I chose WordPress<br> because I enjoy working with it.<br>
                We had only used it twice before, so I wanted to add some elements<br>
                to it that I didn't know how to work with.

            <h2>Single Player Game</h2>
            <p>
                I made this game last period for an assignment that was given to us for Development.<br>
                I had a few issues, but those are all fixed now,<br>
                so it is a working game. To create this game, I used Unity and C#.
